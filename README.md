2. __Search__: allows the user to query in the search bar for an encyclopedia entry.
   If the query matches the name of an encyclopedia entry, the user is redirected to that entry‚Äôs page.
   If the query does not match the name of an encyclopedia entry, the user is taken to a search results page that displays a list of all encyclopedia    entries with the query as a substring. For example, if the search query were `ytho`, `Python` appears in the search results.
